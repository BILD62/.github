# Introduction to Python for Biologists

This Github repository contains the course materials for multiple iterations of BILD 62 (Introduction to Python for Biologists). You can find a recent syllabus (Winter 2024) for the course [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K2Wz9ka75gRDGLG0kmMkVgPsDxwSLAhyurqLT_ZB72Y/edit?usp=sharing) and the corresponding course materials are in the BILD62_WI24 repository.

Note that there are also private repositories containing assignments and development of course materials. If you are a course instructor and would like access to those repositories, please reach out to Ashley Juavinett (ajuavine[at]ucsd.edu). 

You can read more about our work in Zuckerman & Juavinett (*SIGCSE*, 2024), and do not hesitate to reach out with questions!
